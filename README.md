The RDFData collected within the Open Discovery Project.

See more about that also in the github pages

of the WUMM project and the
[WUMM Demonstration Site](http://wumm.uni-leipzig.de/index.php).

### File Name Conventions

* The Turtle file xxx.ttl contains data of the
  <http://opendiscovery.org/rdf/xxx/> RDF graph. Usually xxx is in plural
  form or prepended with "The" (as "TheMatrix").

* The instances within such an RDF graph are named by naming conventions that
  are specified elsewhere (to be added). All instances of a certain type have
  a namespace prefix <http://opendiscovery.org/rdf/xxx/> in common where xxx
  is usually in singular form.

## RDF Graphs
