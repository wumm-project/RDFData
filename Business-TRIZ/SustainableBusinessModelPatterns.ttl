bmp:P10_1
    od:hasContext "In today’s business world, the shareholder model is still the norm and managers’ main responsibility is to meet the expectations of shareholders without giving equal weight to other stakeholders’ interests."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[Ocean Spray] is an American agricultural cooperative that is owned and operated by 750 cranberry and grapefruit growers. Ocean has annual revenues of $2 billion; the cooperative’s members are the only shareholders. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P10_1" ;
    od:hasProblem "As most businesses focus on meeting shareholder expectations, they do not feel accountable for the effects of their activities on other stakeholders. Stakeholders other than shareholders do not benefit equally from businesses’ value creation."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Clinton & Whisnant, 2014)" ;
    od:hasSolution "The cooperative model follows a multi-stakeholder approach and is therefore owned and managed by cooperative members.  Members can be retail consumers, users of services, employees, suppliers, or the local community, for example."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G10 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Cooperative Ownership"@en .

bmp:P11_1
    od:hasContext "When a product or other asset is not used very often, when it is expensive or not fully proven (e.g., emobiles), many consumers are not willing to purchase it. Individual and exclusive ownership also means that more resources must be used to satisfy consumers’ needs."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[Turo (formerly RelayRides)] operates a peer-to peer car sharing marketplace. Private car owners can rent out their vehicles via Turo’s online platform and thus increase the usage of their vehicles while earning money. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P11_1" ;
    od:hasProblem "Private ownership of products results in direct risks, liabilities, and high costs for product users, as well as high levels of resource consumption. Private ownership can also inhibit efficient use of products and other assets."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(FORA, 2010)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Sharing, or collaborative consumption, is about matching the supplier side of a platform with the demand side of that platform.  The product is shared among a number of users, whenever the individual user needs access to the product. Sharing models have in common that the consumer does not pay for buying a product but only for using it."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G11 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Sharing Business"@en .

bmp:P1_1
    od:hasContext "Base of the Pyramid (BoP) and low-income groups in both developed and developing countries are often excluded from consumption due to price barriers."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[Novo Nordisk] sells insulin in developing countries at prices that are up to 20% below the mean prices charged in developed countries. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P1_1", "P7" ;
    od:hasProblem "Customers might need the same product but have different payment thresholds. Hence, some customers are either unwilling or unable to pay as much as others for the same product."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Clinton & Whisnant, 2014)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Charging groups with higher payment thresholds higher prices to subsidize those groups who cannot afford to pay as much."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G01 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Differential Pricing"@en .

    od:hasLFId "P1_2", "P11" ;
    od:hasProblem "Lacking the critical mass required to achieve economies of scale and to make products and services attractive to a broad range of customers."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Clinton & Whisnant, 2014)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Provide a basic service or product free of charge to lower entry barriers for customers, while a fee is charged for additional features and functionality. This allows gaining traction through partly free offerings."@en ;

    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Freemium"@en .

bmp:P1_3
    od:hasContext "Forms of leasing and renting are becoming increasingly popular in the renewable energy industry. Also, lowincome groups are able to purchase goods they otherwise could not afford."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[Simpa Networks] provides distributed energy solutions to underserved consumers in emerging markets on a progressive purchase basis.  Customers first make a small down payment for a solar system and then pre-pay for the energy service they need. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P1_3", "P16" ;
    od:hasProblem "Customers either cannot afford or do not want to buy the product outright. Reasons might be that the product is very new and uncommon, more expensive than traditional products. This can inhibit the diffusion of radical eco- and socioinnovations."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Clinton & Whisnant, 2014)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Offering product leasing or renting for a certain period of time instead of selling it outright. As an option, this can lead to ownership (progressive purchase).  This allows extending breadth and depth of customer groups for new products."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G01 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Innovative Product Financing"@en .

bmp:P1_4
    od:hasContext "Green- or social start-ups that enter new markets are often in need of reliable revenue streams and customer relationships."@en ;

    od:hasLFId "P1_4", "P38" ;
    od:hasProblem "A lack of recurring and predictable revenues and customer relationships threatens a company’s financial stability."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Clinton & Whisnant, 2014)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Charging a customer a rolling fee, typically on a monthly or annual basis for access to a product or service. The customer pays a fee, irrespective of product or service use. This allows creating consistent income streams."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G01 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Subscription Model"@en .

bmp:P2_1
    od:hasContext "Typically, traditional financing requires convincing investors and banks based on expected cash flows. This is often impossible when it comes to sustainability innovations."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[Community Sourced Capital] is an online marketplace that provides a platform for small businesses to source capital from members of their communities. Members finance part of a loan by buying a $50 unit of the loan issued to the business. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P2_1", "P6" ;
    od:hasProblem "Solutions to ecological and social problems often require third-party funding, but do not sufficiently attract mainstream investors or banks."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Clinton & Whisnant, 2014)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Mobilizing a network, usually online, to tap the financial resources of a mixed group of people and to circumvent traditional financiers such as banks. Forms of crowdfunding are e.g. donationbased, loan-based and equity-based."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G02 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Crowdfunding"@en .

bmp:P2_2
    od:hasContext "Traditional banks tend to decline loans to base of the pyramid and low-income groups because of high transaction costs and a lack of collateral and credit history."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[WaterCredit], an initiative launched by the nonprofit Water.org, provides access to safe water and sanitation in developing countries by issuing microfinance loans for clean water and toilets for individual- and communal use. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P2_2", "P21" ;
    od:hasProblem "Base of the pyramid and low-income groups lack access to financial services and thus financial literacy. They often just need small amounts of money to buy muchneeded things or engage in local business."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Clinton & Whisnant, 2014)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Providing small loans and financial services to people without access to conventional banks. Microfinance is often provided through group-lending systems where group members act as guarantors for each other."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G02 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Microfinance"@en .

bmp:P2_3
    od:hasContext "Base of the pyramid and low-income groups, both in developed and developing countries, are often excluded from consumption possibilities due to price barriers or because offerings for these groups do not exist."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[Grameen-Veolia] is a social joint venture with the purpose of bringing safe and affordable drinking water to Bangladesh’s rural population. The water supplier is set up as a selfsustaining, no-loss and no-dividends business. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P2_3", "P37" ;
    od:hasProblem "Financially selfsustaining businesses are needed to offer products and services to base of the pyramid and low-income groups.  These businesses should not be geared towards the interests of investors as this can lead to mission drift."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Michelini & Fiorentino, 2012)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Investors are entitled to get their money back. But profits are not distributed to them as these are reinvested to improve the product or service quality or to fund new social businesses. Social target groups benefit from improved product and service quality and/or lower prices."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G02 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Social Business Model: No dividends"@en .

bmp:P3_1
    od:hasContext "There is a growing need of reducing the use of virgin, finite resources and diminishing waste and pollution, in particular when it comes to complex products that use critical resources such as rare earths."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[Epson’s] EcoTank printer range is comprised of printers that are equipped with refillable ink tanks with a printing capacity of up to 50 ink cartridge sets, depending on the model. While these printers come with a hefty price tag, their ink tanks are not only more convenient and durable than regular ink cartridges, but also provide higher cost savings in terms of page yield. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P3_1", "P13" ;
    od:hasProblem "To avoid early obsolescence and related resource wastage products must be built to last. But companies need an incentive to offer products that are sold less frequently."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Planing, 2015)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Employing a hybrid model that combines a durable product and short-lived consumables. That is, selling a long-lasting device, such as a copier, and remanufacturing its short-lived parts, such as toner cartridges, where the company obtains revenues mainly from the consumables."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G03 ;
    a od:Pattern ;

bmp:P3_2
    od:hasContext "Because of increasing threats to human health and natural ecosystems there is a growing need of reducing the use of finite resources and diminishing waste and pollution."@en ;
    od:hasExample "To help achieve their Mission Zero, [Interface] developed Microtuft, a new carpet tile that uses 50% less yarn than conventional tiles. The company purchases raw materials that are recycled or bio-based and uses ultrasonic cutting equipment, which reduces excess trimmings and improves resource efficiency. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P3_2", "P19" ;
    od:hasProblem "Resource efficiency, including physical materials and energy, must be increased to save resources and reduce waste."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Bocken et al., 2014)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Seeking to improve resource efficiency, reduce waste and emissions through product and process redesign, such as lean manufacturing, ecoefficiency (Factor 4 and Natural Capitalism), and cleaner production."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G03 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Maximise material productivity and energy efficiency"@en .

bmp:P3_3
    od:hasContext "There is growing pressure on most industries to improve eco-efficiency and effectiveness in products; e.g. due to societal and political expectations for products that support a circular economy."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[Xella Denmark] produces innovative Autoclaved Aerated Concrete blocks that are Cradle-to-Cradle certified. Throughout the entire life cycle of Xella’s products sustainability is a guiding principle, i.e. from raw material extraction to waste. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P3_3", "P27" ;
    od:hasProblem "Product design based on a traditional, linear economy model does often not consider the whole product life cycle and can be ecologically harmful and inefficient."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Kiørboe et al., 2015)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Offering responsible and sustainable products that last, increase users' ecoefficiency, and are reusable, repairable, and/or recyclable. Risks in production and use are reduced, e.g. toxicity. This allows replacing inefficient and harmful product designs."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G03 ;

    skos:prefLabel "Product Design"@en .

bmp:P3_4
    od:hasContext "Because of increasing threats to human health and natural ecosystems there is a growing need of reducing the use of finite resources and diminishing waste and pollution."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[Adnams], a British brewery, built a new distribution center using primarily low carbon materials with excellent insulating properties (e.g. lime and hemp) and also installed solar heating and rainwater recovery systems. The new production equipment is of high quality and efficiency – e.g. 90% of the heat produced in one brew is used to in the next brew. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P3_4", "P39" ;
    od:hasProblem "Industrial production inputs and processes often depend on finite resources, cause environmental harm, and are thus not resilient in the long-term."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Bocken et al., 2014)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Substituting finite and non-recyclable production inputs with renewable resources and designing processes based on nature-inspired principles, e.g. closing material and energy cycles."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G03 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Substitute with renewables and natural processes"@en .

bmp:P4_1
    od:hasContext "In the current industrial economy, opportunities to leverage wasted and underutilized resources (e.g.  materials, energy, capacities, assets) are overlooked as companies tend to focus on their main products only."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[British Sugar], the largest sugar producer in the UK, uses wastes from sugar production, such as residual resin and pulp, for the production of chemical products and animal feed, which are later sold on the market. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P4_1", "P5" ;
    od:hasProblem "Unused surplus material, waste and production costs must be reduced, while new revenue sources are needed, e.g. to support the economics of a new kind of product."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Albino & Fraccascia, 2015)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Using the by-products from product generation as input for additional products that can be used by the company itself or sold on the market.  This allows reducing waste, optimizing material flows, and increasing revenues."@en ;
    od:toPatternGroup bmg:G04 ;
    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Co-Product Generation"@en .

bmp:P4_2
    od:hasContext "In the current industrial economy, opportunities to leverage wasted and underutilized resources (e.g.  materials, energy, capacities, assets) are often overlooked, partly because their potential cannot be exploited by single organizations."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[Industrial symbiosis of Kalundborg in Denmark], where several industrial actors exploit each other’s by-products, surplus and waste materials on a commercial basis, including energy and water exchanges. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P4_2", "P15" ;
    od:hasProblem "Companies, industrial clusters and municipalities need to optimize and reduce their material and energy streams and associated costs."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Beltramello et al., 2013)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Employing a shared or cascaded use of resources, byproducts, and waste materials among different actors on a commercial basis. Establishing inter-firm exchanges and linkages driven by the need to reduce virgin inputs, waste, and costs.  This allows reducing waste and optimizing material flows among multiple organizations."@en ;

bmp:P4_3
    od:hasContext "In the current industrial economy, opportunities to leverage wasted and underutilized resources (e.g.  materials, energy) are often overlooked, partly because their potential cannot be exploited by single organizations. Connecting waste producers and users becomes crucial."@en ;
    od:hasExample "[smileexchange.ie] is a free online platform where resource exchanges between members are facilitated through technical assistance, in order to increase cost savings, reduce waste going to landfill and to create new business opportunities. "@en ;
    od:hasLFId "P4_3", "P23" ;
    od:hasProblem "A lot of what is labeled waste can still be useful for some producers.  But useful waste has to be offered by one partner while it has to be identified by another."@en ;
    od:hasReference "(Albino & Fraccascia, 2015)" ;
    od:hasSolution "Creating an electronic marketplace for waste that matches supply and demand, enabling the exchange of waste between actors and retaining the value contained in materials. Companies providing such services gain earnings from commissions on transactions."@en ;

    a od:Pattern ;
    skos:prefLabel "Online Waste Exchange Platform"@en .

bmp:P4_4
