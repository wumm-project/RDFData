    skos:note "The core offering is priced competitively, but there are numerous extras that drive the final price up. In the end, the costumer pays more than he or she initially assumed. Customers benefit from a variable offer, which they can adapt to their specific needs."@en, "Das Kernangebot ist preislich wettbewerbsfähig, aber es gibt zahlreiche Extras, die den Endpreis in die Höhe treiben. Am Ende zahlt der Kunde mehr, als er ursprünglich angenommen hat. Die Kunden profitieren von einem variablen Angebot, das sie an ihre spezifischen Bedürfnisse anpassen können."@de, "Основное предложение имеет конкурентоспособную цену, но существует множество дополнительных услуг, которые увеличивают конечную цену. В итоге потребитель платит больше, чем предполагал изначально. Клиенты выигрывают от переменного предложения, которое они могут адаптировать к своим конкретным потребностям."@ru;

The company, on the other hand, is able to gain access to a more diverse potential customer base without additional active sales or marketing efforts."@en,"Основное внимание уделяется поддержке других людей в успешной продаже товаров и непосредственной выгоде от успешных сделок.  Аффилированные лица обычно получают прибыль в виде вознаграждения за продажу или за показ. С другой стороны, компания получает доступ к более разнообразной потенциальной клиентской базе без дополнительных активных продаж или маркетинговых усилий."@ru, "Der Schwerpunkt liegt darin, andere dabei zu unterstützen, Produkte erfolgreich zu verkaufen und direkt von erfolgreichen Transaktionen zu profitieren.

    skos:note "In this model, services or products from a formerly excluded industry are added to the offerings, thus leveraging existing key skills and resources. In retail especially, companies can easily provide additional products and offerings that are not linked to the main industry on which they were previously focused. Thus, additional revenue can be generated with relatively few changes to the existing infrastructure and assets, since more potential customer needs are met."@en ;

    skos:note "A product, project or entire start-up is financed by a crowd of investors who wish to support the underlying idea, typically via the Internet.

    skos:note "Customers are retained and loyalty assured by providing value beyond the actual product or service itself, i.e., through incentive-based programs. The goal is to increase loyalty by creating an emotional connection or simply rewarding it with special offers. Customers are voluntarily bound to the company, which protects future revenue."@en ;

bmp:Digitisation

    a od:BusinessModelPattern ;
    skos:note "This pattern relies on the ability to turn existing products or services into digital variants, and thus offer advantages over tangible products, e.g., easier and faster distribution.  Ideally, the digitization of a product or service is realized without harnessing the value proposition which is offered to the customer. In other words: efficiency and multiplication by means of digitization does not reduce the perceived customer value."@en ;

    a od:BusinessModelPattern ;
    skos:note "Direct selling refers to a scenario whereby a company's products are not sold through intermediary channels, but are available directly from the manufacturer or service provider. In this way, the company skips the retail margin or any additional costs associated with the intermediates.  These savings can be forwarded to the customer and a standardized sales experience established. Additionally, such close contact can improve customer relationships."@en ;

    a od:BusinessModelPattern ;
    skos:note "The value of a product or service is increased with the customer experience offered with it. This opens the door for higher customer demand and commensurate increase in prices charged. This means that the customer experience must be adapted accordingly, e.g., by attuning promotion or shop fittings."@en ;

    skos:note "Fractional ownership describes the sharing of a certain asset class amongst a group of owners. Typically, the asset is capital intensive but only required on an occasional basis.  While the customer benefits from the rights as an owner, the entire capital does not have to be provided alone."@en ;

    skos:note "The franchisor owns the brand name, products, and corporate identity, and these are licensed to independent franchisees who carry the risk of local operations. Revenue is generated as part of the franchisees’ revenue and orders.  The franchisees benefit from the usage of well known brands, know-how, and support."@en ;

    a od:BusinessModelPattern ;
    skos:note "The basic version of an offering is given away for free in the hope of eventually persuading the customers to pay for the premium version. The free offering is able to attract the highest volume of customers possible for the company. The generally smaller volume of paying ‘premium customers’ generate the revenue, which also cross-finances the free offering."@en ;

    od:hasNumber "19" ;
    a od:BusinessModelPattern ;
    skos:note "This pattern describes the strategy of a company to decentralize and thus add flexibility to the company's processes in order to be more customer focused. To quickly and flexibly respond to new customer needs, any part of the value chain - including production or even research and development - can be affected."@en ;

    od:hasNumber "20" ;
    a od:BusinessModelPattern ;
    skos:note "Within this model, the availability of a product or service is guaranteed, resulting in almost zero downtime. The customer can use the offering as required, which minimizes losses resulting from downtime. The company uses expertise and economies of scale to lower operation costs and achieve these availability levels."@en ;

    od:hasNumber "21" ;
    a od:BusinessModelPattern ;
    skos:note "The logic that the user is responsible for the income of the business is abandoned. Instead, the main source of revenue comes from a third party, which cross-finances whatever free or low-priced offering attracts the users. A very common case of this model is financing through advertisement, where attracted customers are of value to the advertisers who fund the offering. This concept facilitates the idea of 'separation between revenue and customer'."@en ;

    skos:note "Ingredient branding describes the specific selection of an ingredient, component, and brand originating from a specific supplier, which will be included in another product. This product is then additionally branded and advertised with the ingredient product, collectively adding value for the customer. This projects the positive brand associations and properties on the product, and can increase the attractiveness of the end product."@en ;

    skos:note "An integrator is in command of the bulk of the steps in a value-adding process. The control of all resources and capabilities in terms of value creation lies with the company. Efficiency gains, economies of scope, and lower dependencies from suppliers result in a decrease in costs and can increase the stability of value creation."@en ;

    a od:BusinessModelPattern ;
    skos:note "A layer player is a specialized company limited to the provision of one value-adding step for different value chains. This step is typically offered within a variety of independent markets and industries. The company benefits from economies of scale and often produces more efficiently.

    skos:note "Efforts are focused on developing intellectual property that can be licensed to other manufacturers. This model, therefore, relies not on the realization and utilization of knowledge in the form of products, but attempts to transform these intangible goods into money. This allows a company to focus on research and development. It also allows the provision of knowledge, which would otherwise be left unused and potentially be valuable to third parties."@en ;

    a od:BusinessModelPattern ;
    skos:note "Customers are locked into a vendor's world of products and services. Using another vendor is impossible without incurring substantial switching costs, and thus protecting the company from losing customers. This lock-in is either generated by technological mechanisms or substantial interdependencies of products or services."@en ;

    od:hasNumber "28" ;
    a od:BusinessModelPattern ;
    skos:note "Instead of concentrating on blockbusters, the main bulk of revenues is generated through a 'long tail' of niche products. Individually, these neither demand high volumes, nor allow for a high margin. If a vast variety of these products are offered in sufficient amounts, the profits from resultant small sales can add up to a significant amount."@en ;

    skos:note "The buyer pays any desired amount for a given commodity, sometimes even zero. In some cases, a minimum floor price may be set, and/or a suggested price may be indicated as guidance for the buyer. The customer is allowed to influence the price, while the seller benefits from higher numbers of attracted customers, since individuals’ willingness to pay is met.

Performance based contractors are often strongly integrated into the value creation process of their customers. Special expertise and economies of scale result in lower production and maintenance costs of a product, which can be forwarded to the customer. Extreme variants of this model are represented by different operation schemes in which the product remains the property of the company and is operated by it."@en ;

Customers benefit from efficiency and time savings, while putting in their own effort. This can also increase efficiency, since in some cases, the customer can execute a valueadding step more quickly and in a more target-oriented manner than the company."@en ;
