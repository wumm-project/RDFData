tc:Availability
    od:hasLippertNote """The simplest representation of availability is as a ratio of the expected value (E) of the uptime of a system to the aggregate of the expected values of up and down time:
A = E_{uptime}/(E_{uptime} + E_{downtime}) (1)
Classification of availability is based on the span of time to which the availability refers and to the type of downtime used. 
Common classifications include instantaneous, mean, steady state, inherent, achieved, and operational."""@en ;

    od:hasLippertNote """Mean time between failures (MTBF) is the predicted elapsed time between inherent failures of a mechanical or electronic system during normal system operation. 
MTBF can be calculated as the average time between failures of a system. 
The term is used for repairable systems, while mean time to failure (MTTF) denotes the expected time to failure for a nonrepairable system. 
The definition of MTBF depends on the definition of what is considered a failure for the system."""@en ;
